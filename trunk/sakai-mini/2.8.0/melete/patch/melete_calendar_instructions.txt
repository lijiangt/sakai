Instructions to remove Melete's dependency on the Calendar tool
1. Execute the patch file /patch/melete_calendar_patch.txt on the melete source directory. This will create a separate interface for the calendar integration functionality.
2. Replace the file /melete-impl/src/java/org/etudes/component/app/melete/MeleteCalendarServiceImpl.java with /patch/MeleteCalendarServiceImpl.java
3. Remove the sakai-calendar-api dependency in /melete-impl/project.xml (or /melete-impl/pom.xml)
4. Execute maven commands to build and deploy Melete.
