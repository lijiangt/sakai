<h2>Taking an assessment</h2>










<p>To take an assessment, you can use the URL supplied by your
instructor, or, from within Tests &amp; Quizzes, click its name in the list
of available assessments.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Accessing the assessment from within the application
may allow you to save your work and come back to it (depending on how
your instructor has configured the settings), whereas the option to save
your work is not available when you take the assessment from the URL.
See <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardi">Resume taking a saved assessment</a>.</p>

<p>If you have the ability to create assessments in a site, you must
use the URL to take an assessment. Otherwise, in Tests &amp; Quizzes, you'll
only be able to view the Assessments page, which contains your core
and published assessments.</p>

<p>If you don't have the ability to create assessments in a site, and
don't want to use the URL:</p>

<ol><li>From the site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Take an assessment", you will see a list of available
assessments. Click an assessment's title to see information about the
assessment, such as the date due, whether or not there is a time
limit, and whether or not the assessment will automatically be
submitted if the time limit expires.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Begin Assessment</code></strong> to take the assessment, or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort.
</li></ol>

<p>Depending on how the assessment has been set up, you may have the
option during the assessment to save your work and continue, to submit
it, and to return to previous sections or questions.  If your
instructor has enabled the Mark for Review feature, you can check a
box under each question that you would like to review later.  To go
back to questions you marked, before submitting the test, click
<strong><code>Table of Contents</code></strong>.  Questions you have marked for review will
appear with a question mark.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select an answer before checking the
<strong><code>Mark for Review</code></strong> box.</p>

<p>When you click <strong><code>Submit for Grading</code></strong>, you'll receive a
confirmation number, which you should keep.</p>
