  <comment>This provides some utility classes to support downloading
        of spreadsheet-style data as an XLS or CSV file. It has
        been broken out into its own artifact to avoid adding a
        POI dependency to the standard Sakai JSF components JAR. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
