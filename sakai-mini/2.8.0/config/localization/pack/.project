  <comment>The Config project is home to Sakai configuration and localization files.  Config includes 
	several versions of sakai.properties, a text file containing a series of key/value pairs 
	that provide a convenient mechanism for defining a variety of configuration options for 
	Sakai tools, services, supporting database and UI-related text such as copyright statement, 
	institutional name, server name, etc.  Settings in sakai.properties are read on startup; thus 
	changes to sakai.properties only take effect after you restart Sakai&apos;s servlet 
	container (typically Apache Tomcat).</comment>
