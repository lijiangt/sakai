	  <h4><a name="CCLicense"></a>Creative Commons License</h4>
      <p>Creative Commons is a Massachusetts non-profit corporation founded on the notion that some people may not want to exercise all of the intellectual property rights the law affords them. The core team is based at the <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society</a>. </p>
      <p>With a Creative Commons license, <span class="bold">you keep your copyright</span> but allow people to copy and distribute your work provided they give you credit -- and only on the conditions you specify here. Creative Commons believe there is an unmet demand for an easy yet reliable way to tell the world "Some rights reserved" or even "No rights reserved." Many people have long concluded that all-out copyright doesn't help them gain the exposure and widespread distribution they want. Many entrepreneurs and artists have come to prefer relying on innovative business models rather than full-fledged copyright to secure a return on their creative investment. Still others get fulfillment from contributing to and participating in an intellectual commons. For whatever reasons, it is clear that many citizens of the Internet want to share their work -- and the power to reuse, modify, and distribute their work -- with others on generous terms. Creative Commons intends to help people express this preference for sharing by offering the world a set of licenses on our Website, at no charge.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Disclaimer: </span>Foothill College   developed the Melete authoring tool; however, it does not provide licenses nor is responsible for any abuses of the licenses selected. We provide the Creative Common's license options, plus a plain-language summary and machine-readable translation as provided by the organization. They are not a law firm. They are much like a legal self-help press that offers form documentation -- at no cost -- for you to use however you see fit. They cannot afford to provide any ancillary services particular to your situation and their mission does not include providing such services. </p>

      <p class="style2">Creative Commons License Terms &amp; Conditions:</p>
      <h5><a name="attribution"></a><img src="http://creativecommons.org/icon/by/standard.gif" alt="">Attribution</h5>
      <p>The licensor permits others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work. In return, licensees must give the original author credit. </p>
      <h5><a name="noncommercial"></a><img src="http://creativecommons.org/icon/nc/standard.gif" alt="">Noncommercial</h5>
      <p>The licensor permits others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work. In return, licensees may not use the work for commercial purposes -- unless they get the licensor's permission. </p>
      <h5><a name="noderivative"></a><img src="http://creativecommons.org/icon/nd/standard.gif" alt="">No Derivative Works</h5>
      <p>The licensor permits others to copy, distribute, display and perform only unaltered copies of the work -- not derivative works based on it. </p>
      <h5><a name="sharealike"></a><img src="http://creativecommons.org/icon/sa/standard.gif" alt="">Share Alike</h5>
      <p>The licensor permits others to distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the one that governs the licensor's work.</p>
      <p>For more information on the Creative Commons License, see the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/faq" target="_blank">FAQ's</a> or the <a href="http://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> organization's site. </p>
      <h4><a name="publicdomain"></a>Public Domain</h4>
      <p>If you want to offer your work with no conditions, choose the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/" target="_blank">public domain dedication</a>. </p>
      <p>A dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or conceived.</p>

            <h4><a name="fair_use" id="fair_use"></a>Fair Use Exception </h4>
            <p>The &ldquo;Fair Use Exception&rdquo; option  should be selected when you do not own all the content of a module that you will publish and therefore cannot claim copyright or share it. However, the material is subject to fair use exception when used for educational purposes with a restricted number of students for a specific term.</p>            <p align="left"><a href="#top" class="style3">Back to Top </a></p>
            <h4><a name="copyright" id="copyright"></a>Copyright of Author </h4>
            <p>Any material that is published online is automatically copyright-protected. No one other than you, the author of the material, can use, modify or sell your content, whether you included a copyright notice or not. If you select the copyright option, the system will add the copyright notice on the footer of your module. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>To retain full copyright of your content, select &ldquo;Copyright of Author&rdquo; from the drop-down list. Click on I AGREE to continue. A copyright notice, your name, and year will appear at the footer of your module.</li>
            </ul>            <p align="left"><a href="#top" class="style3">Back to Top </a></p>
            <h4><a name="comparison"></a>Creative Commons License, Public Domain, or Copyright </h4>
      <p class="italics">&quot;Why should I turn my work over to the public domain, or make it available under a Creative Commons Custom license, if copyright provides more legal protection?&quot; you may ask? </p>
      <p>You might do so for a few reasons. Some people may be attracted by the notion of others building upon their work, or by the prospect of contributing to an intellectual commons. As the Creative Commons community grows, licensors will have the satisfaction of helping develop new ways to collaborate. Or you might license your stuff purely out of self-interest. A scholar might want his writings to be copied and shared so that his ideas spread around the world. An upstart designer may want to encourage the unfettered dissemination of her sketches to help build a reputation. An established commercial musician might post samples to whet the public's appetite for his other, fully protected songs. A political activist may want her message to reach the widest possible audience through unlimited copying. </p>
